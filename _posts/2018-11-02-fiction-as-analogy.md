title: Fiction as Analogy for God's Relationship to Creation
---

I think that fiction is useful as an analogy for understanding how God relates
to his creation. After all, we are made in the image of God, and our capacity to
create is a reflection of God's capacity to create. Thus, understanding how we
relate to our creation helps us to understand how God relates to his.

These thoughts here are in no way finalized. We're trying to probe the mind of
God here, you don't figure this all out overnight. You may never understand it
at all.

# Ways the analogy is helpful
## Sovereign over creation
In the same way the author has total control and authority over the story, God
has total control and authority over creation. 

## Antecedent vs consequent will
As an oversimplified definition, God's "antecedent will" is what he desires to
happen, and his "consequent will" is what he allows to happen. Believe it or
not, this is evident in fiction as well. Tolkien is said to have truly desired
that Gollum/Smeagol would repent, and went through several different endings
where he did. However, he ultimately realized that it simply didn't work. The
best authors often have to write in or remove things in ways that improve the
story, but are still displeasing to the author.

In the same way, God desires that all people be saved, but in his sovereignty,
for some reason beyond our understanding, allows some to remain condemned.

## Seeing the whole picture
The author knows the whole story all at once. He can flip to any point in the
book and change anything, and understands how everything will work out. The
characters, on the other hand, "experience" the story one page at a time. Thus,
they could never hope to fully understand the author's designs.

In the same way, we experience time at a constant rate of one second per second,
while God is outside of time and can see the whole of it at once. When he acts,
he does so with far greater knowledge than we have.

# Ways the analogy breaks down

While the analogy to fiction is very helpful, it does break down in some
important ways.

## Fictional characters are not conscious
A fictional character is not conscious the same way a human is. So we may argue
that J.K. Rowling writing that Harry Potter is tortured by Umbridge is not
immoral, since Harry is not conscious. But God allowing a human to be tortured
*is* immoral, since we are conscious.

## The incarnation
The author cannot become a character in his story. If I wrote myself into a
story as a character, it would not be *me* in the story, it would be a character
*modeled after me*. God, however, somehow became fully human while remaining
fully God; he was able to literally enter our universe. Thus, there is some
difference in kind there.

# Conclusion
We have no ability to ever fully comprehend God's relationship to creation. So
it is unsurprising that those areas where the analogy works may seem to
contradict the places the analogy doesn't work. We know that God is absolutely
sovereign, and as Paul says in Romans 9, there is no reason that he cannot allow
someone to be condemned. Just as Disney screenwriters are not immoral for
allowing Gaston, or Mufasa, or Tedashi to die, God is not immoral for allowing
sin to enter this world. The fact that we are conscious and fictional characters
are not is a dilemma, yes. But as the analogy is necessarily imperfect, so is
our understanding. God allowed sin into the world knowing what it would cost him
to save us. We know he must be good. So though it is beyond our understanding
exactly *how*, we know that God is not immoral for allowing sin and unrepentance.
