        <h1 id="nature">What is Our Nature?</h1>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>Where does our nature come from?</h2>
            <p>Humans, unique among all other creatures, are created in God's image. This means that we, as much as possible, reflect God's attributes. These attributes include creativity, rationality, religiosity, lovingness, morality, self-awareness, and possibly others. However, some attributes of God, such as omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence belong only to God, and we do not possess them.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>Are humans basically good?</h2>
            <p>Human nature is not basically good; we are basically evil. "There is no one who does good, not even one" (<i>Christian Standard Bible</i>, Psalm&nbsp;14:3). Though humanity was created originally good, the Fall has tainted our nature. Though we are still capable of doing good things, we almost always do them for the wrong reasons. We can do good but not right.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>Do we have immaterial souls?</h2>
            <p>Yes. We are incarnate spirits, and equally we are bodies with souls. The immaterial spirit gives us awareness of truths not grounded in the physical, such as morality and the existence of God. It is also the seat of personality and consciousness. However, neither our physical bodies nor immaterial spirits are more "real." Each is an integral part of ourselves. Our physical nature and spiritual nature are intertwined, and can even affect one another. For example, an <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/educational-resources/brain-basics/brain-basics.shtml#WorkingBrain">imbalance of neurotransmitters can result in mental illness such as depression</a>; in the opposite direction, conscious attempts to relax the mind can <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2014/07/03/just-a-few-minutes-of-mindfulness-meditation-may-reduce-stress/#60ffcd44775a">reduce levels of stress hormones.</a></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>Do we have free will?</h2>
            <p>While it is difficult to resolve belief in an omnipotent, omniscient God with belief in human free will, I am convinced that we do have free will. We experience a decision-making process, and that is enough evidence to convince me. Of course, we do not have <em>autonomous</em> will. There is always some influence or another that affects our decisions. However, we are not merely automatons, with purely deterministic thought processes. God, who perfectly understands us, knows every decision we will make, and every decision we could have made, and what circumstances would have caused us to decide differently. But we still make our own decisions. We have free will.</p>

        <h1 id="world">What is Our World?</h1>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>What is the ultimate reality?</h2>
            <p>God is the ultimate reality, in the sense that He is the only entity that exists without external cause. All else that exists exists only because God gives it being. That is not to say, however, that everything <em>is</em> God, as Hindus believe of Brahmin. You, I, and the computer you're reading this on are distinct objects, and are not God. God is the ultimate reality because all else that exists finds its being through him.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>Has the universe always existed?</h2>
            <p>No, the universe had a beginning. Logically, it must have. While infinity is a useful mathematical construct, nothing in the universe is actually infinite. For example, if I start pouring sand into a pile, the pile will always contain a finite number of grains. Similarly, if I were to start counting the number of days after today, there would always be a finite number of days. Thus, if the universe did not begin a finite number of days ago, today could never have arrived. Clearly, it has arrived, and thus the universe has existed for a finite amount of time.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>Is there a divine being?</h2>
            <p>If you haven't guessed yet, I do in fact believe in God. There are numerous logical reasons to believe in God, but the one I find most convincing is the "first cause" argument. Every effect must have a cause; everything that begins to exist. Since the universe began to exist, it must have had a cause. That cause must be external to the universe, since the universe did not exist before it began. Thus, there must be an external cause, and that cause can be called "God." However, I don't believe in the impersonal "first cause" god proposed by deists. I believe in a personal God who created the entire universe.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>How can we know what God is like?</h2>
            <p>God has revealed himself in two ways: natural revelation and special revelation. Natural revelation describes how God has revealed himself through the universe. Special revelation is God specifically revealing himself through the Bible.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>What does nature tell us about God?</h2>
            <p>It tells us that God is a talented engineer; everything works perfectly and is exquisitely designed. It tells us that God is a great artist, because so much in the world is aesthetically beautiful. It tells us that God intends life to be enjoyable, because we can find enjoyment and pleasure in necessary tasks such as eating and working. It tells us that God has given humanity a special place in creation; many things seem to be designed specifically to serve humans. Herbs and spices seem to exist purely to flavor foods, or to serve medicinal purposes. My favorite example is the North American bison; it has single-chambered lungs, meaning that it can be easily killed with a single well-placed arrow. This has no benefit to the bison. Rather, it seems to be only to make bison easier to hunt.</p>
            
            <p>Nature also tells us that God is a moral being, with a moral standard. Every one of us has a natural sense of right and wrong. While this sense is altered by our fallen nature and the differing standards imposed by culture, we all innately know right from wrong. And thus, we know that we are accountable to God for our actions, which are by-and-large evil. This is also part of how we know that the Fall has happened. We all have an innate sense that <i>something is wrong.</i></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>What does the Bible tell us about God?</h2>
            <p>The Bible tells us that God is triune; three persons, but one God. God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, which are one in substance but yet distinct, in a way that cannot be comprehended by human reason. The Bible also tells us the Son became human in the form of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Jesus was fully God and fully human; human in every respect as we are, but divine as we are not. This is another great mystery that cannot be understood by human reason. The Bible tells us that God is good, merciful, loving, just, hard but fair, patient, kind, all-knowing, all-powerful, and ever-present.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>Does objective truth exist?</h2>
            <p>Yes. To say that objective truth does not exist is an objective truth claim, and is thus nonsensical and false. I can't believe I even have to answer this question.</p>
            
            <p>This extends to moral truth as well. It's fairly simple to demonstrate that moral relativism is unlivable. Anyone can believe in relative morality, until they feel that <i>they</i> have been wronged. However, this does not necessarily prove that morality is not actually relative. It only shows that we can't live as if it is. However, if we bear the image of God, and God is moral, it stands to reason that we would be moral creatures; thus, within my worldview, it makes sense to claim that our inability to live out moral relativity demonstrates its falsity.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>Is there a world beyond the physical?</h2>
            <p>Yes. There is a nonphysical, spiritual world, which includes God, the heavenly host, the demons, and our own souls. To say that nothing exists beyond the physical world is to deny our own experience. Our minds and our consciousness are immaterial, even if they are formed only by our material brains (which I doubt). Information is immaterial, even if it can only be expressed through a physical medium. If only the material exists, then our minds and thoughts cannot exist. However, I'm reasonably confident that my mind exists and my thoughts are real.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>How old is the universe? Did God create through evolution?</h2>
            <p>I believe the universe is about 6000 years old. God created in six literal days, and Darwinian evolution did not occur. As science tells us more about biology and genetics, natural selection as a means of creation seems more and more ridiculous. Even if it were supernaturally guided by God, it seems a clumsy means to create, uncharacteristic of our elegant and precise God.</p>

    <div class="problem">
        <h1 id="problem">What is Our Problem?</h1>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>Why is there evil?</h2>
            <p>God created creatures with free will. First, Satan rejected God. Then, Adam and Eve (at Satan's prompting, though it didn't take much) also disobeyed God. As punishment, God cursed all of creation. This event is called the Fall.</p>
            
            <p>Now, because of the Fall, everything is broken and on fire and falling apart. It's a disaster. We are cut off from fellowship with God. Creation, which was made to be useful to us, now fights and resists us, and we fail to care for it as we ought. Our relationships are broken and fallen. We are no longer at peace with ourselves.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>What's the solution?</h2>
            <p>Jesus, fully human and thus able to act on our behalf, sacrificed himself on the cross. He lived a perfect life, and did not deserve to die and be separated from the Father. He was God, and thus his life was of infinite worth. Thus, he died as a willing substitute, sufficient for all mankind. Jesus has paid for the sins of anyone who believes in him. We must surrender ourselves fully to God.</p>
            
            <p>Though Jesus died, He didn't stay dead. After three days in the tomb, He rose from the dead. This is how we know Jesus was God. 1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:6 says that "he appeared to over five hundred brothers and sisters at one time." This is a bold claim to make <a href="http://adam4d.com/doubting/">if it isn't true.</a> You may also make the argument that if the apostles began inventing stories about a resurrected Jesus, the religious leaders who killed him would have simply produced the body. But they didn't, because there was no body to produce.</p>
            
            <p>God's redemptive plan extends to all creation, and not just to humanity. Someday, Jesus will return, and God will make all of creation new. The world will be restored to its former perfection. Everything will be right again.</p>
            <!-- Come soon, Lord Jesus. Thank you for your sacrifice. Forgive me for my sins. Make me new. Make everything new.-->
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>If God is omnipotent and good, why didn't He stop the Fall from happening?</h2>
            <p>I can't really answer this question. I can guess, but God's ways are not our ways, so there is no guarantee that I can understand his reasons for doing things. However, a few things can be said that may shed some light on the issue. If God had created humanity to be incapable of sinning, we would not have had free will. God could have created a world without evil, but not one that had humans. Furthermore, it is possible that the Fall is a necessary, temporary evil to bring about some greater good. However, this is a difficult argument to make in the face of child abuse, rape, mass starvation, and oppression. So I can't answer this question for sure, but I have faith that God is good and had a good reason for allowing the Fall.</p>

        <h1 id="end">What is Our End?</h1>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>What is our purpose?</h2>
            <p><a href="http://www.shortercatechism.com/resources/wsc/wsc_001.html">According to the Westminster Shorter Catechism</a>, the chief end of man is to "glorify God, and to enjoy him forever." This is entirely correct, but of course you can go into more detail. In Genesis 1, God charged Adam and Eve to "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and every creature that crawls on the earth" (Genesis&nbsp;1:28). Essentially, God's creation is intended to be useful to us, and we are charged with its care. We are to exercise the creative potential that God gave us. In a sense, we are "finishing the job" of creation, taking what God has made and turning it even further to his glory.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>What happens when we die?</h2>
            <p>When we die, what happens to us depends on what we believed about Jesus. If someone believed that Jesus was God, and chose to follow him, then they don't stay dead. When he returns, they will be resurrected with new and perfect bodies, and we will live with God forever. If, however, they did not follow Jesus, then they will suffer in eternal punishment in Hell. While I am a bit clearer about the nature of Heaven -- it will be physical, a universe as perfect as the pre-Fall world -- I am less certain about the nature of Hell. I know it is a place of eternal torment and separation from God, but I do not know whether it is physical or purely spiritual. I don't adhere to annihilationism; the torment is eternal, and Hell's inhabitants will not be destroyed. I don't adhere to universalism; the populations of Heaven and Hell are fixed after the Second Coming. But both Heaven and Hell are real.</p>
