        <h1 id="nature">What is Our Nature?</h1>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>Why are we the way we are?</h2>
            <p>Humans are the only creatures made in God's image. This means that we reflect God's attributes, including creativity, rationality, religiosity, lovingness, morality, self-awareness, and more. However, some of God's attributes, such as omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence, belong only to God. Thus, we do not share in these traits.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>Are humans basically good?</h2>
            <p>Human nature is not basically good; we are basically evil. "There is no one who does good, not even one" (<i>Christian Standard Bible</i>, Psalm&nbsp;14:3). Though humanity was created originally good, the Fall has tainted our good nature. Now, every desire of our hearts is evil and selfish. We are still capable of doing good things, but we almost always do them for the wrong reasons. We can do good but not right.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>Do we have immaterial souls?</h2>
            <p>Yes. We are incarnate spirits. Equally, we are bodies with souls. The immaterial spirit gives us awareness of nonphysical truths, such as morality and the existence of God. It is also the seat of personality and consciousness. However, neither our physical bodies nor our immaterial spirits is more "real." Both are essential, intertwined parts of humanity. The body and soul can even affect one another. For example, an imbalance of neurotransmitters (a physical change) <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/educational-resources/brain-basics/brain-basics.shtml#WorkingBrain">can result in mental illnesses such as depression</a> (a nonphysical change); in the opposite direction, conscious attempts to relax the mind (a nonphysical change) can <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2014/07/03/just-a-few-minutes-of-mindfulness-meditation-may-reduce-stress/#60ffcd44775a">reduce levels of stress hormones</a> (a physical change).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>Do we have free will?</h2>
            <p>While it is difficult to reconcile God's omniscience with the idea of free will, I am convinced that we do have free will. The undeniable experience of a decision-making process is evidence enough for me. However, we don't have <em>autonomous</em> will. There is always some influence or another that affects our decisions. God, who perfectly understands us, knows every decision we will make, every decision we could have made, and what circumstances would have caused us to decide differently. But we still make those decisions ourselves. We have free will.</p>

        <h1 id="world">What is Our World?</h1>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>What is the ultimate reality?</h2>
            <p>God is the ultimate reality, in the sense that he is the only thing which exists without an external cause. Everything else exists only because God gives it being. That is not to say, however, that everything <em>is</em> God, as Hindus believe of Brahmin. You, I, and the computer you're reading this on are distinct objects. You and I are not God. I say that God is the ultimate reality because all else that exists finds its being through him.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>Has the universe always existed?</h2>
            <p>No, the universe had a beginning. Logically, it must have. While infinity is a useful mathematical construct, nothing in the universe is actually infinite. For example, if I start pouring sand into a pile, the pile will always contain a finite number of grains. If I kept pouring forever, the upper limit would be "infinity grains," but at any point in time the number would always be finite. Similarly, if I were to start counting the number of days after today, there would always be a finite number of days. Thus, if the universe did not begin a finite number of days ago, today could never have arrived. Clearly, it has arrived, and thus the universe has existed for a finite amount of time.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>Is there a divine being?</h2>
            <p>If you haven't guessed yet, I do in fact believe in God. There are numerous logical reasons to believe in God, but the one I find most convincing is the "first cause" argument. Every effect must have a cause. The beginning of the universe is an event, an effect. Therefore, the universe must have had a cause. That cause must be external to the universe since something that does not exist cannot do anything, let alone cause itself to exist. Thus, something outside the universe must have caused the universe to begin, and that cause can be called "God." However, I don't believe in the impersonal "first cause" god proposed by deists. I believe in a personal God who created the universe with a purpose.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>How can we know what God is like?</h2>
            <p>God has revealed himself in two ways: natural revelation and special revelation. Natural revelation is how God reveals himself through his creation. Special revelation is how God reveals himself through the Bible, using actual words.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>What does nature tell us about God?</h2>
            <p>It tells us that God is a talented engineer; everything works wonderfully and is exquisitely designed. It tells us that God is a great artist, because the world is aesthetically beautiful. It tells us that God intended for life to be enjoyable, because we can find enjoyment and pleasure even in necessary tasks such as eating and working. It tells us that God has given humanity a special place in creation, because many things seem to be designed specifically to serve humans. My favorite example of this is the North American bison; its two lungs connect to form a single chamber, meaning that it is easily killed with a single well-placed arrow. This has no benefit to the bison at all, but it makes the gigantic, untameable animal far easier to hunt.</p>
            
            <p>Nature also tells us that God is a moral being, with a moral standard. Every one of us has a natural sense of objective right and wrong. While this sense is altered by our fallen nature and the differing standards imposed by culture, we all innately understand morality. And thus, we know that we are accountable to God for our actions, which are by-and-large evil. We also can get an idea of the Fall from this; we all have an innate sense that <i>something is wrong.</i></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>What does the Bible tell us about God?</h2>
            <p>The Bible tells us that God is triune; three persons, but one God. God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, which are one in substance but yet distinct in a way that cannot be comprehended by human reason. The Bible also tells us the Son became human in the form of Jesus Christ. Jesus was fully God and fully human; human in every respect as we are, but yet divine. This is another mystery that can only be taken by faith. The Bible also tells us that God is good, merciful, loving, just, hard but fair, patient, kind, all-knowing, all-powerful, and ever-present.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>Does objective truth exist?</h2>
            <p>Yes. To say that objective truth does not exist is an objective truth claim, and is thus nonsensical and false. I can't believe I even have to answer this question.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>Is there a world beyond the physical?</h2>
            <p>Yes. There is a nonphysical, spiritual world which includes God, the heavenly host, the demons, and our own souls. To say that nothing exists beyond the physical world is to deny our own experience. Our minds are immaterial, even if (as naturalists suppose) they are formed merely by our physical brains. Information is immaterial, even if it requires a physical medium to express and store. If there are no immaterial things, then our minds and thoughts cannot exist. However, I'm reasonably confident that my mind exists and my thoughts are real, and so I believe in the immaterial.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>How old is the universe? Did God create through evolution?</h2>
            <p>I believe the universe is about 6000 years old, that God created in six literal days, and that Darwinian evolution did not occur. I have never heard of a way to fit millions of years into the Genesis narrative that I found convincing, so I believe in the young earth. As science tells us more about biology and genetics, natural selection as a means of creation seems more and more ridiculous. I also don't think God would have created through Darwinian evolution; it seems uncharacteristically clumsy and imprecise. Theistic evolution has God trying every possible design before finally arriving at the "winning solutions" that we see today, like a drunken man stumbling awkwardly through every possible alleyway and at last chancing upon his house.</p>

    <div class="problem">
        <h1 id="problem">What is Our Problem?</h1>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>Why is there evil?</h2>
            <p>God created creatures with free will. All things were originally created perfect and good. But Satan rejected God. Then, Adam and Eve (at Satan's admittedly minimal prompting) also disobeyed God. As punishment, God cursed all of creation. This event is called the Fall.</p>
            
            <p>Now, because of the Fall, everything is broken and on fire and falling apart. It's a disaster. We are cut off from fellowship with God. Creation, which was made to be useful to us, now fights and resists us, and we fail to do our duty and care for it. Our relationships with each other are broken and fallen. We are no longer at peace with ourselves. The inherent goodness of creation still shines through, but nothing is like it's supposed to be.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>What's the solution?</h2>
            <p>Jesus, fully human and thus able to act as a substitute for us, sacrificed himself on the cross. He lived a perfect life and did not deserve to die and be separated from the Father. He was God, and thus his life was of infinite worth. Thus, he died as a willing substitute, sufficient for all mankind. Jesus has paid for the sins of anyone who believes in him. We must surrender ourselves fully to God.</p>
            
            <p>Though Jesus died, he didn't stay dead. After three days in the tomb, he rose from the dead. This is how we know Jesus was God, and there are very good reasons to think that it actually happened. 1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:6 says that "he appeared to over five hundred brothers and sisters at one time." This is a bold claim to make <a href="http://adam4d.com/doubting/">if it isn't true.</a> Additionally, if the apostles began inventing stories about a resurrected Jesus, the religious leaders who killed him would have simply produced his body. But they didn't, because there was no body to produce. He is risen.</p>
            
            <p>God's redemptive plan extends to all creation, and not just to humanity. Someday, Jesus will return, and God will make all of creation new. The world will be restored to its former perfection. Everything will be right again.</p>
            <!-- Come soon, Lord Jesus. Thank you for your sacrifice. Forgive me for my sins. Make me new. Make everything new.-->
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>If God is omnipotent and good, why didn't he stop the Fall from happening?</h2>
            <p>I can't really answer this question. I can make guesses, but God's ways are not our ways, so there is no guarantee that I can understand his reasons for doing things. However, a few things can be said that may shed some light on the issue. If God had created humanity to be incapable of sinning, we would not have had free will. So God could have created a world without evil, but not one that had humans. Furthermore, it is possible that the Fall is a necessary, temporary evil to bring about some greater good, but this is a difficult argument to make in the face of child abuse, rape, mass starvation, and oppression. So I can't answer this question for sure, but I have faith that God is good and had a good reason for allowing the Fall.</p>

        <h1 id="end">What is Our End?</h1>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>What is our purpose?</h2>
            <p><a href="http://www.shortercatechism.com/resources/wsc/wsc_001.html">According to the Westminster Shorter Catechism</a>, the chief end of man is to "glorify God, and to enjoy him forever." This is entirely correct, but you can go into more detail. In Genesis 1, God charged Adam and Eve to "be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Rule the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and every creature that crawls on the earth" (Genesis&nbsp;1:28). God's creation is intended to be useful to us, and we are charged with its care. We are to exercise the creative potential that God gave us to, in a sense, finish the job of creation, taking what God has made and turning it even further to his glory.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">
            <h2>What happens when we die?</h2>
            <p>When we die, what happens to us depends on what we believed about Jesus. If someone believes that Jesus was God, and chose to follow him, then they don't stay dead. When Jesus returns, they will be resurrected with new and perfect bodies, and will live with God forever. If, however, they did not follow Jesus, then they will suffer in eternal punishment in Hell. While I feel safe in saying some things about Heaven&mdash;namely, that it will be physical, our universe sans the Fall&mdash;I am less certain about the nature of Hell. I know it is a place of eternal torment and separation from God, but I do not know whether it is physical or purely spiritual. I don't adhere to annihilationism; the torment is eternal, and Hell's inhabitants will not be destroyed. I don't adhere to universalism; the populations of Heaven and Hell are fixed after the Second Coming. However, whatever Heaven and Hell are like, they are the only two possible destinations after we die.</p>
